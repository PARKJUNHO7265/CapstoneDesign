<h3>Subject</h3>

**Real-time sign language gesture recognition model**

As a result of the 2017 survey of the people who have deafness, 

69.3% of all respondents responded that sign language was the most used communication method.

When using facilities such as restaurants, it is impossible for deaf people to order through conversation, 

and it is hard to communicate through writing each time.

Therefore, if a sign language interpreter is installed in each store, 

deaf people will also be able to use the service conveniently.
